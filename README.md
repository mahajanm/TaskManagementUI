Angular UI Project 

I have created an angular app with 15 version. Tried to implement the standard practice about layout and implementation of the angular application. 
 
Covered all the CRUD operations along with authentication.  

Handled exceptions. 

Handle UI notifications on actions. 

Handle minimal validations on required actions and data. 

Applied lazy loading. 

Used bootstrap, font awesome for CSS, referred bootstrap site for css details. 

Implemented client-side pagination.
 
Note: As we are not using any login screen, I have implemented authentication flow on application initialization. For this specific application initialization scenario, where I have called the auth service on module initialization and stored the token received from API in local storage, to authenticate access referred google as this scenario I was referring first time. 

Steps to run on local 

Clone this repository on local  

1 (Via Command line) Navigate to directory and first run "npm install" and then run npm start. Ensure your UI is accessible (typically on http://localhost:4200)  
 
or Open solution in visual studio code and then project folder and using terminal run the highlighted command in sequence.
